description: A guide for setting up and running a Fraxtal Node.

## Hardware requirements

We recommend running a node with no less than the following resources:

- 16 GB RAM
- 500GB of NVMe storage

## Running a Node

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/FraxFinance/fraxtal-node).
2. Copy the relevant file (`.env.testnet.SAMPLE`, `.env.mainnet.SAMPLE`) into a new file without the .SAMPLE suffix: (`.env.testnet`, `.env.mainnet`).
3. Edit the resulting file as needed, such as using your own L1 RPC endpoint.
4. Run `docker compose -f testnet.docker-compose.yml up`. Confirm you get a response:

```bash
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:8545
```
